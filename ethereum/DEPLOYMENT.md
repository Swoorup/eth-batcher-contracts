# Deployment

The current version (version 1b) of the contract is deployed at

`0xca11012301B4584ff218c709f9f276b3C433a1Ce`

It reads:

- 0xca110123: "call-1,2,3" which describes the function of this
  contract: to call another contract, and split the payment received
  to 1 or 2 or 3 recipients".

- The number `01b` that followed meant that it is the version 1b of
  this contract.

Historically deployed versions of the contracts may be destructed by
me, for security reasons or other reasons. Consider either coming here
to look for the latest deployement address, or deploy your own.

The deployment address is created using profanity:

` ./profanity.x64 --contract --matching ca11012301XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
